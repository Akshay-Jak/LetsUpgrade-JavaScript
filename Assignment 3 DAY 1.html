        <h1>DATA TYPES IN JAVA SCRIPT</h1>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Like anyother programming language Java Script also has a set of data types.
            There are eight basic data types  Java  Script is called dynamically typed i.e. data types exist but
            variables are not bound to them.
        </p>
        <h2>1.NUMBER</h2>
        <p>The number represents both integer and the floating point numbers . There are many operations in this data type.
        </p>
        <h3>2.BIGINT</h3>
        <p>This data type is for representing integers of arbitary length.This type is used when we need big
            numbers i.e. for cryptography or microsecond precision timestamps.
        </p>
        <h4>3.STRING</h4>
        <p>Like anyother programming language a string Java script is the same. A string must be denoted
           between a single or a double quote  
        </p>    
        <h5>4.BOOLEAN</h5>
        <p>The boolean type has only two values True and False.</p>
        <h6>5.NULL</h6>
        <p>In Java script null is not a 'null pointer' or a 'reference to a non-existing object',but is a special 
            value which represents 'nothing',its just an empty value.
        </p>
        <h7>6.OBJECTS AND SYMBOLS</h7>
        <p>Object is a special type that are used to store colllection of data and more complex entities.
            Symbols are used to create a unique identifiers for objects.We have to mention it here for the sake 
            of  completeness, but can also postpone the details till we know obejcts.
        </p>
        <h8>7.TYPEOF OPERATOR</h8>
        <p>The typeof operator returns the type of the argument.It is useful when we want to process values
            of different types differently or just want to do a quick check.
            It can be written as typeof x-operator (or) typeof(x)-function.
        </p>
        <h9>8.UNDEFINED VALUE</h9>
        <p>Its a special value like null.It makes  its own type.It means 'the value is not assigned'
        </p>
